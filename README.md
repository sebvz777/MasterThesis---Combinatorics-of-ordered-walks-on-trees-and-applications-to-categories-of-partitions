# MasterThesis - Combinatorics of ordered walks on trees and applications to categories of partitions

This thesis investigates the structure and algorithmic properties of the partition category $\Pi_{k \in\mathbb{N}}$, which plays a central role in the theory of easy quantum groups. Categories of partitions are associated with easy quantum groups. T. Banica and R. Speicher first introduced these categories in 2009, and S. Raum together with M. Weber completed their classification in 2016. We prove that the category $\Pi_{k \in\mathbb{N}}$ is related to ordered walks on rooted plane trees and provide insights about the previous research in this area. Ordered walks, as we use them, were introduced by A. Khorunzhy and V. Vengerovsky in the early 2000s as a combinatorial tool for studying spectra of large random matrices and rooted‚Äêtree models. With this work as a foundation, we are able to count the number of partitions in the category $\Pi_{k \in\mathbb{N}}$ up to a partition size of $300$ in a few seconds. Furthermore, we propose efficient algorithms to decide whether a specific partition is in $\Pi_{k \in\mathbb{N}}$.
